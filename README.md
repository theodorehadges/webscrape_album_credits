# Webscraping Album Credits

## Example of output
An example of the output for one album can be seen [here](). Otherwise, if you wish
to run the code yourself (perhaps for another artist/album), feel free to
follow the instructions below.

## Instructions

This is a simple Python script which scrapes album credit data from
allmusic.com. 

1. Open a Terminal window (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal)
2. Copy and paste the following, pressing `ENTER` after each line:
3. `git clone https://github.com/theodorehadges/webscrape_album_credits.git` 
4. If it prompts you to install git, you can press `y` followed by `ENTER`
5. `cd webscrape_album_credits`
6. `python3 get_album_credits`
7. A plain text file will be generated in the current directory
